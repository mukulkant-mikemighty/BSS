AUDIO SOURCE SEPARATION DATASET.

This dataset has been constructed from audio excerpts taken from the Bach10 dataset
by Duan et al. [1]. This database can be used in performance evaluation and results
can be compared with the ones presented in my PhD thesis [2], Section 5.8.5, on pa-
ges 153-158, in Chapter 5. A percussive sequence from the Open Air Library [3], has
also been used in these experiments.
